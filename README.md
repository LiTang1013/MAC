# AMC
A novel scaffolding algorithm based on adjacency algebraic model and classification

## Pre-installed:

PHP: http://www.php.net/

MUMmer: http://mummer.sourceforge.net/ 

Please make sure the path of MUMmer has been added into system variable.

## Usage: 

php AMC.php <contig_1.fasta> <contig_2.fasta> ... <paired_reads1.fastq> <paired_reads2.fastq> <read_length> <insert_size> <output_path>


## Option:
	
<contigs.fasta>	Contig files generated by different assembly methods. At least two contig files are needed, please separate each file with space

<paired_reads1.fastq>	The left end of Paired-end/mate-pair reads file

<paired_reads2.fastq>	The right end of Paired-end/mate-pair reads file

<read_length>	The average length of paired reads

<insert_size>	The insert size of paired reads

<output_path>	The path to store the result files

-h      Show help message 

-e      Use evaluation

## Demo:

Here we provide a demo for testing the performance of AMC, users can run the commandline:

```
php AMC.php soap_ctg.fa abyss_ctg.fa velvet_ctg.fa reads_1.trimmed.fastq reads_2.trimmed.fastq 250 600 /path_of_output/out_name
```
